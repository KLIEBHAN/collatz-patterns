# Experiments (index)

This folder collects experiment specifications, GPT extracts (for provenance), and short summaries.

## Specs
- `M2-M4-spec.md` — pre-registered experimental spec (our v1)
- `M2-M4-spec_gpt.md` — GPT 5.2 Pro extract of an M2–M4 spec (raw, preserved)

## Lemma roadmap
- `lemma-roadmap_gpt.md` — GPT 5.2 Pro lemma-candidate roadmap (raw, preserved)
- `lemma-roadmap_summary.md` — 1-page executive summary we actually use

## Conventions
- Raw GPT extracts are kept as-is (sometimes ugly unicode/math). They are **sources**, not polished docs.
- Anything we adopt should be reflected in the pre-registered spec and/or a clean summary.
